This is a basic version of Battle Ship that I am making to get back into the swing of coding before college. 
This isn't going to be super detailed or polished. I plan on making a functional version of this game that is played with ascci graphics and playing in the terminal.
This is also my first project on Github so I am using this to learn the workflow as Github is a great resource to have.
